    <body> 
    My name is Jenna Bregante, and I am a current Junior at Syracuse University studying Information Management and Technology with a concentration in Web Design and a minor in Public Communications. In the near future, I hope to intern and later on work for a larger media or entertainment company in which I can aid with the advertising or branding of the company. I am confident that my unique academic track, coupled with my experience in and passion for social media, PR, and brand building, will aid me in the initial transition into the professional world. I currently work as a brand affiliate and social media analyst for an international beauty and marketing company, NuSkin. In this position, I curate frequent social media posts and advertise branded products to represent NuSkin via a personal online storefront. This summer, I also worked as a Social Media Intern at a local modern healthy food restaurant in which I planned, captured, edited, and circulated social content that was both engaging and on-brand. This educational year I became a part of an on campus organization called TEDx, in which I am the director of social media. Growing up, I participated in competitive dance since I was eight, and continue to grow my passion for dance by being a part of a student run club, DanceWorks at SU. In my free time, I enjoy teaching myself how to cook, traveling with family, and spending time with friends.
