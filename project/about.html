    <div class="about">
        <p>On this site, you will find my collaboration of meals and recipes that have been passed down by my grandmother, 
            mother, friends, and even some I have found and loved online! I decided to put them all into one place, 
            since it can be hard to meal plan each week and I don’t know about you, 
            but I always forget my recipes! You can make these as a college student, 
            to continue eating (somewhat) healthy while still enjoying flavorful meals, 
            or you can cook for your entire family at home… I promise they will love it! 
            Here are some of my personal favorites:</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hi, I’m Jenna Bregante, a college junior at Syracuse University, creator of “bregantesbites”. Growing up in a fully Italian family, 
        food is something that is very important to both me and family, along with all of our family recipes and traditions. From my grandma’s 
        meatballs, to my grandpa’s sauces, and my mother’s amazing versatile meals I grew up on, I have my bar set high for food. With that said, 
        and after going through a difficult semester this year, I decided to finally learn how to cook for myself and create a new hobby. To start, 
        I began FaceTiming my mom in my college apartment, and basically teaching myself to follow along in her footsteps of cooking. I figured, why not 
        share the recipes that I can easily make with all of my friends that are also in college who struggle with meal planning/cooking, and then 
        created an Instagram account to do so. (feature link to Instagram account here) Now, I have created this website where you can find all of these 
        recipes that I have tried so far in one place, in a beginner/easy-to-follow language.
